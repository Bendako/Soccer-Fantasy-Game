Introduction
Welcome to Api-Football! You can use our API to access all API endpoints, which can get information about Football Leagues & Cups.

We have language bindings in C, C#, cURL, Dart, Go, Java, Javascript, NodeJs, Objective-c, OCaml, Php, PowerShell, Python, Ruby, Shell and Swift! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

The update frequency indicated in the documentation is given as an indication and may vary for certain competitions.

Authentication
We uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new API key in our dashboard.

The accounts on RapidAPI and on our Dashboard are dissociated. Each of these registration methods has its own URL and API-KEY. You must therefore adapt your scripts according to your subscription by adapting the URL and your API-KEY.

RAPIDAPI : https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/

API-SPORTS : https://v3.football.api-sports.io/

Our API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

Make sure to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx with your API key.

REQUESTS HEADERS & CORS

The API is configured to work only with GET requests and allows only the headers listed below:

x-rapidapi-host
x-rapidapi-key
x-apisports-key
If you make non-GET requests or add headers that are not in the list, you will receive an error from the API.

Some frameworks (especially in JS, nodeJS..) automatically add extra headers, you have to make sure to remove them in order to get a response from the API.

API-SPORTS Account
If you decided to subscribe directly on our site, you have a dashboard at your disposal at the following url: dashboard

It allows you to:

To follow your consumption in real time
Manage your subscription and change it if necessary
Check the status of our servers
Test all endpoints without writing a line of code.
You can also consult all this information directly through the API by calling the endpoint status.

This call does not count against the daily quota.

get("https://v3.football.api-sports.io/status");

// response
{
    "get": "status",
    "parameters": [],
    "errors": [],
    "results": 1,
    "response": {
        "account": {
            "firstname": "xxxx",
            "lastname": "XXXXXX",
            "email": "xxx@xxx.com"
        },
        "subscription": {
            "plan": "Free",
            "end": "2020-04-10T23:24:27+00:00",
            "active": true
        },
        "requests": {
            "current": 12,
            "limit_day": 100
        }
    }
}
Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:

x-ratelimit-requests-limit: The number of requests allocated per day according to your subscription.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: The number of remaining requests per day according to your subscription.
X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum number of API calls per minute.
X-RateLimit-Remaining: Number of API calls remaining before reaching the limit per minute.

RAPIDAPI Account
All information related to your subscription are available on the rapidApi developer dashboard.

The RapidAPI developer dashboard is where you can see all of your apps, locate API keys, view analytics, and manage billing settings.

To access the dashboard, simply login to RapidAPI and select 'My Apps' in the top-right menu. Alternatively, you can head directly to https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard.

In the main dashboard, you will see account-wide analytics and account information. To get more detailed information, you can select tabs on the left-hand side of the screen.

App Specific Analytics
Using the RapidAPI dashboard, you can also view analytics specific to each app in your account. To do so, switch over to the 'Analytics' tab of your application in the dashboard.

On the top of the page, you'll be able to see a chart with all the calls being made to all the APIs your app is connected to. You'll also be able to see a log with all the request data. You are also able to filter these analytics to only show certain APIs within the app.

In each graph, you can view the following metrics:

API Calls: how many requests are being made
Error rates: how many requests are error some
Latency: how long (on average) requests take to execute
You may change the time period you're looking at by clicking the calendar icon and choosing a time range.

Headers sent as response
When consuming our API, you will always receive the following headers appended to the response:

server: The current version of the API proxy used by RapidAPI.
x-ratelimit-requests-limit: The number of requests the plan you are currently subscribed to allows you to make, before incurring overages.
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: The number of requests remaining before you reach the limit of requests your application is allowed to make, before experiencing overage charges.
X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Response: This header is set to true when the RapidAPI proxy generates the response, (i.e. the response is not generated from our servers)

Logos / Images
Calls to logos/images do not count towards your daily quota and are provided for free. However these calls are subject to a rate per second & minute, it is recommended to save this data on your side in order not to slow down or impact the user experience of your application or website. For this you can use CDNs such as bunny.net.

We have a tutorial available here, which explains how to set up your own media system with BunnyCDN.

Logos, images and trademarks delivered through the API are provided solely for identification and descriptive purposes (e.g., identifying leagues, teams, players or venues). We does not own any of these visual assets, and no intellectual property rights are claimed over them. Some images or data may be subject to intellectual property or trademark rights held by third parties (including but not limited to leagues, federations, or clubs). The use of such content in your applications, websites, or products may require additional authorization or licensing from the respective rights holders. You are fully responsible for ensuring that your usage of any logos, images, or branded content complies with applicable laws in your country or the countries where your services are made available. We are not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by any sports league, federation, or brand featured in the data provided.

Sample Scripts
Here are some examples of how the API is used in the main development languages.

You have to replace {endpoint} by the real name of the endpoint you want to call, like leagues or fixtures for example. In all the sample scripts we will use the leagues endpoint as example.

Also you will have to replace XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXx with your API-KEY provided in the dashboard or on rapidapi.

Widgets
Our widgets are completely free and work with all our plans including the free plan.

To integrate the widgets to your site you just have to copy/paste the code provided and fill in the tags needed for the widget to work properly. If you integrate several widgets on the same page a single theme will be applied for all widgets. Also you will only have to integrate the script tag once.

For all widgets the following tags are needed :
data-host : v3.football.api-sports.io or api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com depending on whether you have subscribed with us or RapidApi.

data-key : Indicate your API-KEY obtained on our Dashboard or on RapidApi.

data-theme : If you leave the field empty, the default theme will be applied, otherwise the possible values are grey or dark. It is also possible to indicate false which will not display any theme and lets you customize the widget with your own css.

data-show-errors : By default false, used for debugging, with a value of true it allows to display the errors.

Widgets use the requests associated with your account and therefore they will stop working if your daily limit is reached. You can track all requests made directly in the dashboard.

Security :
When using these widgets it is important to be aware that your API-KEY will be visible to the users of your site, it is possible to protect yourself from this by allowing only the desired domains in our dashboard. This way no one else can use your API-KEY for you. If you have already set up your widget and have not activated this option, you can reset your API-KEY and activate this option after.

Debugging :
If the widget does not display the requested information, it is possible to set the data-show-errors tag to true to display error messages directly in the widget and in the console. This can be due to several things like : (Non-exhaustive list)

You have reached your daily number of requests

Leagues
Leagues
Get the list of available leagues and cups.

The league id are unique in the API and leagues keep it across all seasons

To get the logo of a competition you have to call the following url: https://media.api-sports.io/football/leagues/{league_id}.png

This endpoint also returns the coverage of each competition, which makes it possible to know what is available for that league or cup.

The values returned by the coverage indicate the data available at the moment you call the API, so for a competition that has not yet started, it is normal to have all the features set to False. This will be updated once the competition has started.

You can find all the leagues ids on our Dashboard.

Example :

"coverage": {
  "fixtures": {
      "events": true,
      "lineups": true,
      "statistics_fixtures": false,
      "statistics_players": false
  },
  "standings": true,
  "players": true,
  "top_scorers": true,
  "top_assists": true,
  "top_cards": true,
  "injuries": true,
  "predictions": true,
  "odds": false
}
In this example we can deduce that the competition does not have the following features: statistics_fixtures, statistics_players, odds because it is set to False.

The coverage of a competition can vary from season to season and values set to True do not guarantee 100% data availability.

Some competitions, such as the friendlies, are exceptions to the coverage indicated in the leagues endpoint, and the data available may differ depending on the match, including livescore, events, lineups, statistics and players.

Competitions are automatically renewed by the API when a new season is available. There may be a delay between the announcement of the official calendar and the availability of data in the API.

For Cup competitions, fixtures are automatically added when the two participating teams are known. For example if the current phase is the 8th final, the quarter final will be added once the teams playing this phase are known.

Examples available in Request samples "Use Cases".

Most of the parameters of this endpoint can be used together.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated several times a day.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per hour.

CANC	Match Cancelled	Cancelled	Cancelled, match will not be played
ABD	Match Abandoned	Abandoned	Abandoned for various reasons (Bad Weather, Safety, Floodlights, Playing Staff Or Referees), Can be rescheduled or not, it depends on the competition
AWD	Technical Loss	Not Played	
WO	WalkOver	Not Played	Victory by forfeit or absence of competitor
LIVE	In Progress	In Play	Used in very rare cases. It indicates a fixture in progress but the data indicating the half-time or elapsed time are not available
Fixtures with the status TBD may indicate an incorrect fixture date or time because the fixture date or time is not yet known or final. Fixtures with this status are checked and updated daily. The same applies to fixtures with the status PST, CANC.

The fixtures ids are unique and specific to each fixture. In no case an ID will change.

Not all competitions have livescore available and only have final result. In this case, the status remains in NS and will be updated in the minutes/hours following the match (this can take up to 48 hours, depending on the competition).

Although the data is updated every 15 seconds, depending on the competition there may be a delay between reality and the availability of data in the API.

Update Frequency : This endpoint is updated every 15 seconds.

Recommended Calls : 1 call per minute for the leagues, teams, fixtures who have at least one fixture in progress otherwise 1 call per day.
